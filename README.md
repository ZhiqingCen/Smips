# Smips, Simple MIPS

- Development of MIPS Emulator in C:
  - Implemented an emulator (smips.c) to process 32-bit MIPS instruction codes given as hexadecimal numbers.
  - Accurately decoded and executed MIPS instructions, converting hexadecimal codes to their corresponding assembly instructions.
- Syscall Handling and Output Generation:
  - Integrated syscall handling to emulate MIPS system calls, producing correct output for printf and other syscalls as specified in the input.
  - Ensured the emulator correctly outputs the results of system calls during execution.
- Register State Management:
  - Maintained and updated the state of MIPS registers throughout the execution of instructions.
  - Provided detailed output of register values after program execution, showing the final state of each register.
- Demonstrated Proficiency in C Programming and MIPS Architecture:
  - Enhanced understanding of both C programming and MIPS architecture through the development of a functional emulator.
  - Demonstrated ability to handle low-level instruction decoding and execution within a high-level language environment.
